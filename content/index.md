Welcome to my blog.

I share notes, essays, and lists of my favorite things here.

It will become more personal over time, but it's currently a collection of interesting ideas or philosophies I wanted to explain to friends that are too long to be contained in a message.

A quick tldr of each:
- Curations
    - [Bookmarks](/Curations/Bookmarks): my favorite bits of the internet
    - [Favourite Self-help](/Curations/Favourite-Self-help): a list of insightful tweets, blogs, and other writing that's helped my personal growth and formed my worldview
- Longform
    - [For Autodidactism](/Longform/For-Autodidactism-(or,-why-I-dropped-out)): my rationale behind not attending university (from an admittedly-overly-monetary perspective)
    - [Crushed by a deterministic treadmill](/Longform/Crushed-by-a-deterministic-treadmill): what factors increase the longterm happiness of a population?
    - [I miss the child I never was](/Longform/I-miss-the-child-I-never-was): a reflection/journal entry on growing up and losing the sense of wonder
- Notes
    - [Possessions and the Extended Self](/Notes/Possessions-and-the-Extended-Self): a seminal paper on behavioural psychology: how do individuals define their identities and express themselves through identity?
    - [Stutz](/Notes/Stutz): a documentary on Jonah Hill and his therapist, as an extended conversation on philosophy and mental models on life
